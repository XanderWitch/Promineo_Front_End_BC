    <p>
        Can use "debugger" keyword in the js "debugger;" Will pause code execution and enter debugger.

        "Step over" moves execution forward one line.

        Look up how to use VS Code debugger.

        Call Stack = stack of how functions got called , nesting of functions. You can see what is waiting to happen. Where you are right now. First in, last out (like a stack of pancakes). Can put debugger inside function.

        Strict Mode (see team.js)

        //Lexical (lexical = where it is written) Scope

        Scope flows downward/into blocks (surrounded by curly brackets). But it does not flow back out. Scope is defined by where it is typed and defined, not by where it is called from.


        MDN lexical scope (check)

        React, etc., use the DOM API. (Virtual DOM)
