<h1>Week 1 - Front End Technologies - HTML</h1>
<h2>Class Notes</h2>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol><li>Three HTML Elements from research this week. See <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">MDN Web Docs</a> or inspect any page of interest.</li>
<li>What is a Div Tag? Will cover whole line. Span only covers text within tags.</li>
<li>Salary Ranges - Check glassdoor and indeed (pay attention to region) or levels.fyi for very large companies. Remote work is usually a lower salary.</li>
</ol>

<p>Front-End used to be simple until 10-15 years ago. Now, websites are more interactive and JS is more powerful, so what it means to be a Front-End Developer has changed. May be two skillsets - (1) JS - programming and logic and making applications behave a certain way and (2) HTML & CSS how things look. Two specialties but they can interact.</p>
<h4>DOM and JS & HTML Interaction</h4>
<p>JS was invented after HTML and CSS, a tool to make an HTML interactive/logical.</p>
<p>Layer between HTML document and live memory of program - Document Object Model - a way of representing HTML inside JS code. Ex: JS Ojbect representing a tag in HTML.</p>
<p>Global Object that is always available in JS (e.g., console) - document is an object that lets us 'talk' to the HTML. Can use JS to manipulate your HTML document such as through "getElementById" and "innerHTML".</p>
<p>See Document Object on MDN. Tons of methods. Variables created by document object have a type of "document nodes."</p>
<h4>Responsive - Mobile First Development</h4>
<p>Easier to build something that will respond elegantly at any view. Start small.</p>
<p>main tool - media query - to apply conditional rules that depend on the size of the viewport.</p>
<h4>Dev Tools</h4>
<p>Console Tab, Elements, Sources, Network, etc.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Elements tab shows the HTML. Can mess around with the code to see what changes.</li>
    <li>Styles tab (under Elements) shows all of the CSS. Can mess around with the code to see what changes.</li>
    <li>Dev Tools is also a separate web application.</li>
