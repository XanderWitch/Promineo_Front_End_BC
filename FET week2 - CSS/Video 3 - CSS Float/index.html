    <h1>Using CSS Float</h1>
    <p><img src="cat.jpg" style="width: 30%">The CSS float property enables us to float content either to the left or right side it helps us to align it more here's an example of how to use float. If we open this up we can see that the cat image is over here to the left and the text is over here to the right. However, if we come back in here and we style this image, we can use a HTML tag selector. We can go ahead and say float right. If we save that and this is being used right here the CSS when you come back here and refresh this and see now this is over here on the left and the cat comes after the image comes after the text because it is floating over to the right.</p>
