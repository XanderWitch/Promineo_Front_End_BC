    <h1>CSS Pseudo Classes</h1>
    <p>CSS has something called <b>pseudoclasses,</b> which let us style an element based on its current <i>state,</i> such as if a mouse is hovering over it, if it is a visited link, it has been selected, etc. They are styled the same way, but with a colon and the state. See CSS.</p>
    <p>Note, that we can select very specific elements by using multiple selectors. Good for selecting items inside other elements.</p>
