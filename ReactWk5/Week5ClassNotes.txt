Look up redux devtools chrome extension
Redux good for playing state changes forward and backward, organizes mutations to state, tradeoff - lot of extra complexity

Prop types - a way for enforcing types in components 

Example: 
react.js/org/docs/typechecking-with-prototypes.html

Greeting.propTypes = {
    name: PropTypes.string
}

//react will give an error if the wrong type is entered - this is a built-in feature of React

*Learn Typescript - recommendation

HOCs, hooks may be the same way to do the same thing
reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html

Github page of public apis
github.com/public-apis ... can look for ones with no API key

Postman to test API stuff - can play around with request parameters to see what you get

URL parameterization
https://mysite.com/api -host

get
/users

get
/users? - query parameter
/users?name=Evan&favorite_color=red - for filtering and search

GET - path parameters
/users/{id} e.g. /users/1234


JOB ADVICE
*find a way to collaborate on projects and network a lot
*cold messaging on LinkedIn - reach out directly and start a conversation (or Twitter), find a set of company you like and seek out person on there instead of applying
- direct with recruiter, more indirect with manager or dev, be earnest/authentic

Consider jobs that make use of programming skills that are not developer roles, like tech adjacent roles

Good tech - 

Fullstack - Java and React

Learn deployment (heroku is simpler that AWS)

package-json - scripts section for how to deploy react app - build - npm build - and then copy build files
link github and project URL and then should link to each other - at the top of resume at the top of portfolio. ReadME should be clear with instructions on how to download and run project.

(update GIT)
