    <h1>FET Week 3: Web Servers</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>When we deploy our code to a server, we use a special software called a web or application server to serve our pages and data to the user.</p>
    <p>We'll no longer open files but instead go to a URL on our local host to serve pages like in a browser.</p>
    <p>We'll use Node & NPM (Node Package Manager) to install our http server.</p>
    <h2>Install & Run HTTP Local Web Server</h2>
    <p>To install the server, go to the command line and type "npm install -g [global, accessible to launch from any directory] http-server"</p>
    <p>You want to run the server from the root directory of whatever project you're running. To do so, change to the appropriate directory in the CLI and type "http-server" use the IP or "localhost" plus the port number (e.g., "localhost:8080") in the browser window to open the server with the files in the root directory.</p>
