    <h1>Bootstrap Grid</h1>
    <p>Bootstrap has a mobile-first design. Makes great responsive, mobile-friendly designs.</p>
    <p>Grid system is a great tool for this. A series of containers, rows, and columns to lay out and organize content. The columns are then responsive to screen size, depending on how we define them.</p>
    <h2>Containers</h2>
    <p>When we apply the "container" class to an HTML element, it will be centered and horizontally padded. It also does not take up the entire width of the screen.</p>
    <p>If we want it to take up the whole width of the screen, we can use the "container-fluid" class instead.</p>
    <p>Note that the size of the columns (e.g., "col-sm" "auto" "md" "lg" and "extra large" - check syntax) refers not to the size of the columns but the size of the screen they are being viewed on. Example: Three XL columns will remain side by side on the viewport as long as the screen size is 1440px or larger. When it is smaller, the columns will stack on top of each other. Each size has its own limit. Sm: 576 px. Smaller sizes stack earlier.</p>
    <p>To get columns of different sizes, append numbers to the end of the column class to indicate how much space the column should take up. 12 represents 100% of the row. For example, to get one column twice as wide, use 6 on that one and 3 or auto on the other two.</p>
    <p>Note that columns sizes in different rows can be different. This allows us to structure our pages however we want. We can even nest rows inside of columns.</p>
